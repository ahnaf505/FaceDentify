Welcome to **FaceDentify**! This project is all about comparing faces üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è against a database, whether it's for personal collections or large-scale datasets. Using powerful facial recognition technology, it matches faces and stores important details like full names and unique UIDs (UUIDs) in a simple-to-use `TinyDB` database. It‚Äôs fast, scalable, and includes handy tools like photo labeling üì∏. Perfect for everything from security systems to personal fun!
