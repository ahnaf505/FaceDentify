This project provides a robust solution for comparing a face against a database of any size, from small personal collections to large-scale datasets, using advanced facial recognition technology. The system efficiently matches faces and stores corresponding metadata, such as full names and random UUID, in a `TinyDB` database. Designed for scalability and optimized for performance, it also includes a few really useful tools, including photo labelling and etc., making it ideal for applications ranging from security systems to personal projects.
